## Configuration

Edit `config.json` to configure:
- TTS voice settings
- AI model settings
- Translation language
- Debug mode

### Translation Language Configuration - Field 1

By default, AI generates translations in field 1 in English. **Available languages:** Any language, even Klingon. To change field 1 language to another (e.g., Ukrainian), open `config.json` and replace:

```json
{
    "field_1_response_lang": "Ukrainian"
}
```

**Note:** The add-on automatically uses field indexes in the code ‚Äì so the field names in Anki do not affect anything!

**Context Configuration**

To personalize AI-generated examples for your field/interests:

1. Open: `prompts.json`
2. Find: `"user_context": []`
3. Replace with your context, for example:
   - Medicine: `["medisin", "helse", "sykehus"]`
   - Business: `["√∏konomi", "business", "ledelse"]`
   - IT: `["programmering", "teknologi", "data"]`
   - Education: `["utdanning", "skole", "l√¶ring"]`
   - Law: `["jus", "lov", "rettsvesen"]`

This makes AI examples more relevant to your field when learning Norwegian vocabulary.

### Chatbot Configuration

**Detailed Documentation:** See `ChatBot.md` for configuring quick prompts, translation buttons, and clipboard copy functionality.

**WARNING!** In this version, the Chatbot doesn't remember conversation context to save tokens. It only works in question ‚áí answer mode.


## Support

- Enable debug_mode in config.json for detailed logging
