# InferAnki v0.6.3

**AI-powered Anki add-on to help you learn Norwegian**

## What is Anki?

**Anki** is a **free** flashcard app that uses **spaced repetition**. This is one of the most effective, research-backed ways to memorize information, proven by cognitive psychology studies.

**Official website:** https://apps.ankiweb.net/

Anki is available on both computers and smartphones‚Äîso you can study anywhere, with your progress synced via the cloud.

### Scientific Background

**Ebbinghaus‚Äô Forgetting Curve** (1885) shows how quickly we lose new information.

Without review, we forget:
- **50%** of information in 20 minutes
- **70%** in a day
- **90%** in a week

**Spaced repetition** changes this: by reviewing material at optimal intervals, you move information from short-term to long-term memory with minimal effort.

### How does Anki work?

Anki calculates **optimal review intervals** for each card. After seeing a card, you rate how hard it was to recall, and Anki automatically schedules the next review:
- ‚ÄúEasy‚Äù cards are shown less often.
- ‚ÄúHard‚Äù cards are reviewed more frequently.

The system adapts to your learning pace.

**Result:** Instead of rote memorization, you remember material efficiently and for the long term, spending just 15‚Äì20 minutes a day.

### Why Anki + InferAnki?

InferAnki brings **AI power** to Anki. It adds four buttons to the card editor toolbar:

- ‚ú® **CardCraft**: Generate a complete card from a single word. GPT-5 finds related words, definitions, usage examples, and adds a translation in your chosen language.
- üìù **Examples**: Create extra examples from the text in field 2.
- üë©üèº **TTS**: Generate high-quality AI Norwegian audio for your text.
- ‚òÄÔ∏è **ChatGPT Assistant**: Chat with GPT-5 for detailed help, with quick prompts and copy-to-clipboard (e.g., for translations).

The add-on uses custom prompts to control AI quality. You can flexibly adjust these prompts to your needs.

## System Requirements

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This add-on works **only on the Windows Desktop version of Anki**

 **Why:** The add-on integrates directly into the Anki Desktop card editor using system hooks, Windows-specific file paths, and the built-in Python environment in Anki Desktop. This means you can only run the add-on on Windows, but you can use the generated cards (with audio) on other platforms.
